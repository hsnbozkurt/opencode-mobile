# Functional Specification

## Product Purpose

The mobile app is a client for interacting with an OpenCode server from a phone or tablet. It is optimized for:

- selecting a workspace hosted by the server
- opening or creating chat sessions tied to that workspace
- sending prompts and files to OpenCode
- tracking transcript, file changes, todos, and blocking requests
- configuring providers, models, and voice behavior
- editing workspace text files, managing worktrees/MCP servers, and using project PTYs
- optionally using a hands-free conversation mode

This document describes current user-visible behavior that should be preserved for parity.

## Primary User Journeys

### 1. Connect to an OpenCode Server

The user can enter:

- server URL
- username
- password

Behavior:

- server URL is normalized to include a protocol if omitted
- password is optional; if present, basic auth is sent
- reconnecting re-runs workspace discovery, session fetch, and capability discovery
- connection status can be `idle`, `connecting`, `connected`, or `error`
- connection state includes a human-readable message shown in the UI

### 2. Pick a Workspace

The Workspace tab lists projects returned by the server.

Behavior:

- projects are deduplicated by worktree path
- projects are sorted by most recently initialized/created first
- the active project can be selected from the list
- selecting a project clears the current session selection
- the provider later rehydrates or creates the appropriate session for that project
- the current server project may be labeled `Current`; the selected app project may be labeled `Active`

### 3. Open or Create a Chat Session

The app maintains one active session at a time for the active project.

Bootstrapping behavior:

- if a remembered session exists for the project and still exists on the server, it is reopened
- otherwise the latest available session is used
- if no session exists, one is created automatically

Manual behavior:

- user can create a new session from the Workspace tab
- user can create a new session from the Chat header
- user can switch sessions from the Chat header session sheet

### 4. Send a Prompt

The user can send:

- text only
- files only
- text plus files

Behavior:

- blank text with no attachments is rejected locally
- prompt submission is blocked if another submission is already active
- if no active session exists, the app creates or resolves one first
- local/mobile file URIs are read and converted to data URLs before sending because the server cannot reach device-local paths
- remote `http` and `https` attachment URLs are passed through unchanged
- the selected model must advertise attachment support
- local files larger than 10 MB are rejected before base64 encoding
- request body includes selected agent, selected model, and generated system prompt derived from preferences

After submission:

- active session is refreshed
- transcript, diff, and todos are refreshed
- untitled sessions are summarized using the selected model when possible
- a pending local-notification tracker is created for the session

### 5. Watch the Session Progress

The Chat screen shows:

- transcript messages
- inline running status text while OpenCode is active
- pending permission and question requests if OpenCode is blocked waiting for the user
- a changes tab with current file diffs
- todos when provided by the server

Behavior details:

- only user messages and assistant messages with text or errors appear in the main transcript
- reasoning and tool activity are summarized as metadata chips AND rendered as a per-assistant-message activity feed (one row per tool call, patch, file, reasoning block, or step, with live status icons), matching the web transcript's detail level
- a status line like `OpenCode is ...` is shown while running and not blocked on user input
- if the assistant is blocked on a permission or question, a waiting card and inline interaction render

### 6. Resolve Pending Interactions

Each permission request shows:

- a title derived from `permission`
- optional pattern list
- action buttons: `Allow once`, `Always allow`, `Deny`

Permission behavior:

- requests are received from the global event stream and list API, then stored under `sessionID`
- only interactions for the current or sending session are displayed
- replies use `/permission/{requestID}/reply`
- the replied request is removed locally and that session's messages are refreshed

Question cards render each question's choices, optional custom answer, submit action, and rejection action. Answers preserve question order and support multiple selections.

### 7. Inspect File Changes

The `Files Changed` tab shows the diff produced by the latest user turn in the current session.

Behavior:

- top card shows session subtitle and current status
- current `{ file, patch, additions, deletions }` diff objects are rendered as expandable line previews
- if the message diff is empty, transcript patch details can still show filename-only entries
- if nothing has changed, the user sees `No file changes yet.`

### 8. Manage Sessions in the Workspace Tab

The Workspace tab provides lifecycle operations:

- refresh workspace catalog and sessions
- open a session
- create a new session
- rename a session
- permanently delete a session after confirmation
- archive a session without deleting it
- restore or permanently delete sessions shown by the experimental archived-session list
- share a session and copy its URL, or unshare it

Session list behavior:

- each session row shows title, preview/subtitle, relative updated time, and status
- active session rows are visually emphasized

Additional session actions are available in Chat:

- fork a session from a user message and open the fork
- revert a session from a user message
- undo the current revert

### 9. Inspect And Edit Workspace Files

The Workspace tab provides source inspection and text editing:

- search file paths by query
- open returned files and display server-returned content
- show the number of changed files from file status
- show the current VCS branch when available
- edit the selected text file and save the complete replacement as a VCS patch

Before save, the provider re-reads the file and rejects the operation if the server content differs from the content originally opened. Only non-base64 text files are editable; a successful full-file patch is followed by another read and workspace-status refresh.

### 10. Manage Worktrees

The Workspace tab can list, create, reset, and remove worktrees. Creation accepts an optional name and start command; reset and remove require destructive confirmation. These SDK operations use OpenCode's experimental worktree endpoints, so server availability and response stability are not guaranteed like the non-experimental contract.

### 11. Use The Terminal Tab

The fourth tab uses a compact terminal selector. The plus action creates a PTY with the server default shell (which falls back to bash on the fake server); the selector opens the existing terminals, and the X action closes the selected terminal. Users send newline-terminated input to the selected terminal.

The provider requests a short-lived PTY connect ticket and opens a project-scoped `ws:`/`wss:` connection. The UI is a line console, not a terminal emulator: it strips common ANSI CSI sequences, does not implement VT cursor behavior, and keeps the latest 100,000 output characters.

## Chat Screen Detailed Behavior

## Empty State

When a session has no display transcript yet, the user sees:

- `Start a new task`
- descriptive copy about specific prompts
- tappable starter prompts that immediately send predefined text

## Transcript Behavior

- transcript is paginated from the bottom using a fixed page size
- `Load earlier messages` reveals older transcript entries
- automatic scroll-to-end happens for new content unless the view is currently paginating older items
- long-pressing a message copies its text/error content
- assistant messages can be played with TTS if they contain readable text

## Composer Behavior

Server-owned tasks appear collapsed by default in an overlay over the chat area. Expanding the overlay shows a height-limited, scrollable list without resizing the composer.

The composer includes:

- agent picker
- model picker
- reasoning picker
- auto-approve toggle
- optional conversation mode banner
- slash-command suggestions when the draft starts with `/` and has no space
- attachment chips
- text input
- primary and secondary action buttons

Primary action rules:

- if the session is running and there is no draft content, the main action becomes `stop`
- otherwise the main action is either `attach` or `send`

Secondary action rules:

- with content present, the secondary button attaches files
- without content, the secondary button toggles microphone dictation

Slash command behavior:

- commands are loaded from the server for the active project
- up to six command names matching the current prefix are suggested
- an exact known `/command` submission is sent through the session command API with the remaining text as arguments
- attachments prevent command interpretation and use normal prompt submission

## Abort Behavior

When a session is running and there is no draft content, the main composer action aborts the active session.

Abort behavior:

- clears pending completion notification tracking for the session
- calls the server abort endpoint
- refreshes sessions, messages, diff, and todos

## Auto-Approve Behavior

The auto-approve toggle updates the server config, not just local UI state.

Enabled means these permissions are set to `allow`:

- `edit`
- `bash`
- `webfetch`
- `doom_loop`
- `external_directory`

Disabled sets them back to `ask`.

## Provider / Model / Reasoning Selection

The chat composer exposes runtime choices directly.

Behavior:

- only configured providers contribute models to the model picker
- model choices are also filtered by the enabled-model list from Settings
- the picker shows the provider alongside the selected model, groups results by provider, and searches provider/model names and IDs
- selecting a model updates both `providerId` and `modelId`
- discovered model metadata comes from nested attachment/input modality, tool-call, reasoning, status, and context/output limit capabilities
- reasoning level affects only the generated system prompt, not local control flow

## Session Title Summarization

If a session has no title after a prompt is sent, the app asks the server to summarize the session title using the selected model.

If summarization fails, the session simply remains untitled.

## Settings Screen Detailed Behavior

### Connection Section

Allows editing server URL, username, and password.

Behavior:

- values are persisted locally
- reconnect button explicitly re-runs connection flow
- editing connection values clears server-scoped state but does not reconnect until the button is pressed
- status card shows current state and last checked timestamp

### AI Defaults Section

Purpose:

- show configured providers
- add additional providers
- control which configured models appear in chat

Behavior:

- unconfigured providers appear in an `Add provider` selector
- configured providers display as chips
- models are grouped by provider in accordions
- each model can be toggled on/off from the enabled list
- if all stored enabled models disappear, all currently available configured models become enabled by default

### Provider Configuration Behavior

The app supports two auth styles:

- OAuth
- API/manual auth

Behavior:

- provider auth metadata comes from the server
- if the server returns no auth methods for a non-known-OAuth provider, the app falls back to a generic API-key flow
- if OAuth is selected, the app requests an authorization URL and opens the browser
- code-based OAuth displays a callback dialog and submits the entered authorization code before enabling the provider
- automatic OAuth enables/reconnects after the browser returns without a code dialog
- if API auth is selected, auth values are normalized and sent to `client.auth.set`
- after successful auth, the provider is enabled in server config and capabilities are refreshed
- configured providers can be removed, deleting stored credentials and disabling the provider in config

### Notifications Section

Purpose:

- help the user enable local notifications for task completion
- show a debug-style summary of notification readiness

Behavior:

- on supported platforms, permission status is read from the system
- Android users can be deep-linked to notification settings and battery-related settings
- `Enable notifications` requests permission and refreshes status
- startup initializes notification handling without displaying a permission prompt
- `Refresh status` re-queries permission and background-task registration state

### Diagnostics Section

- reports `/global/health` status and OpenCode version when available
- reports global event stream state, describing non-connected states as polling fallback
- reports MCP, LSP, and formatter counts when their endpoints are available
- each diagnostic request fails independently and can be refreshed manually

### MCP Servers Section

- adds local MCP commands or remote MCP URLs
- refreshes status and connects or disconnects servers
- enables/disables and removes configuration through config updates
- starts remote OAuth in the browser and submits an authorization code callback

### Voice Section

Purpose:

- configure both speech input and speech output behavior
- configure response style controls that are implemented as system prompt hints

Behavior exposed today:

- prefer on-device voice recognition
- auto-play assistant replies
- working sound enable/disable
- resume listening after spoken reply in conversation mode
- speech locale override
- response scope (`brief`, `balanced`, `detailed`)
- include simple next actions toggle
- speech rate
- working sound variant and volume
- TTS voice selection

Working sound runs while a prompt is being submitted or any session is non-idle when enabled. It is stopped while conversation mode is listening or speaking and after work becomes idle.

Important current implementation note:

- response scope and next-actions settings do not change app layout; they only shape the generated system prompt sent to the server

## Conversation Mode Detailed Behavior

Conversation mode is a hands-free loop around one active session.

Entry requirements:

- server must be connected
- no current send operation may be active
- no pending permission or question interaction may be present
- there must be or become an active session

Loop behavior:

1. Start listening continuously.
2. Collect transcript from speech recognition.
3. When a final result settles, submit it as a prompt.
4. Wait until the session is no longer running.
5. Detect the latest assistant reply after the submission baseline.
6. Speak the assistant reply.
7. If configured, return to listening. Otherwise stop.

Additional behavior:

- screen is kept awake while conversation mode is active
- screen brightness is dimmed when possible
- a full-screen overlay is shown
- conversation mode stops if a permission or question requires on-screen input
- speech/TTS failures surface feedback and may stop the mode

## Notifications Behavior

The app attempts to notify when an OpenCode task completes.

Behavior:

- when a prompt is sent, a pending notification tracker is stored locally with connection credentials and project path
- while the app is active, completion can be detected by local provider state and trigger a local notification
- on supported native platforms outside Expo Go, a background task checks pending sessions periodically and emits task-complete notifications

Parity implication:

- notification tracking is coupled to prompt submission and session status transitions
- a rewrite should preserve both in-app completion flushing and background completion checking

## Persistence Requirements

The following values are persisted locally:

- connection settings
- chat preferences
- active project path
- last session ID by project
- pending notification sessions

The following values are not persisted and are rebuilt from the server:

- session list
- session statuses
- messages
- diffs
- todos
- pending permissions and questions
- provider/model/agent catalog
- commands, workspace file results/status/content, VCS info, worktrees, MCP statuses, PTYs, terminal output, archived sessions, and diagnostics

## User-Visible Edge Cases

- If no project exists yet, Chat shows a `Choose a workspace` prompt.
- If a project exists but no session is ready yet, Chat shows a loading panel.
- If connection fails, error copy is shown in the landing/loading states and inside chat content.
- If speech input is unavailable or denied, user-friendly errors are shown.
- If TTS cannot speak a message, a snackbar error is shown.
- If sending fails, draft text and attachments are restored locally.
- Send failures remain visible until dismissed, include asynchronous `session.error` events, and can be copied with session/model context for diagnostics.

## Parity Checklist

Any reimplementation should preserve these functional outcomes:

- automatic reconnection after local settings hydration
- workspace-first session scoping
- remembered last session per project
- transcript + diff + server-owned todo + permission surfaces
- session delete, archive/restore, rename, fork, revert/unrevert, and share/unshare support
- slash command discovery and execution
- workspace file search/view/status plus conflict-checked full-file VCS patch save
- experimental worktree management and archived-session listing
- MCP lifecycle/configuration/OAuth management
- ticket-authenticated PTY line console with bounded, CSI-stripped output
- server diagnostics
- provider discovery and auth configuration from server metadata
- enabled-model filtering separate from model selection
- auto-approve writing back to server permissions config
- attachment conversion from mobile-local URIs to data URLs
- attachment capability enforcement and 10 MB local-file limit
- reconnecting global SSE filtered to the active project, with polling fallback for refreshable session data
- task-complete notification tracking
- optional conversation mode with listen -> submit -> wait -> speak -> listen loop
