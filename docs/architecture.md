# Architecture

## High-Level Shape

The app uses a simple structural pattern:

- Expo Router provides navigation and screen composition.
- `OpencodeProvider` owns nearly all domain state and orchestration.
- Screens are thin and read/write provider state through `useOpencode()`.
- Service modules under `providers/services/` isolate a small amount of API aggregation logic.
- `lib/` contains protocol helpers, formatting, notifications, and voice utilities.
- `components/` contains UI composition only, with very little business logic except local presentation state.

This means the real application architecture is not screen-centric. It is provider-centric.

## Top-Level Runtime Composition

`app/_layout.tsx` sets up the root runtime tree:

1. `SafeAreaProvider`
2. `OpencodeProvider`
3. `PaperProvider`
4. React Navigation `ThemeProvider`
5. Expo Router stack with `(tabs)` as the only visible route group

The same root layout also lazily initializes two side-effect systems on non-web, non-E2E runs:

- notifications via `lib/notifications`
- voice audio mode via `lib/voice/speech-output`

That makes the root layout responsible for app shell concerns only. It does not hold feature state.

## Navigation Architecture

The app has one tab group in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:

- `index` -> Chat
- `workspace` -> Workspace
- `settings` -> Settings
- `terminal` -> Terminal

Navigation complexity is deliberately low. There are no nested feature stacks, no per-screen providers, and no deep in-app route hierarchy.

This matters because state continuity is expected across tabs. Switching tabs does not reset active session context.

## Core Architectural Principle

The dominant design decision is central orchestration through `providers/opencode-provider.tsx`.

This file is the application's effective domain layer. It owns:

- connection settings and connection state
- workspace catalog and active project selection
- session lists and session status tracking
- current session selection and data refresh
- transcript, diff, and todo caches
- session-scoped permission and question queues refreshed by events and list APIs
- provider/model/agent capability discovery
- chat preference management
- prompt send / abort lifecycle
- conversation mode state machine
- notification completion tracking
- global SSE subscription with reconnect and polling fallback
- session lifecycle actions, slash commands, workspace inspection, and diagnostics
- archived-session, worktree, MCP, and PTY terminal orchestration
- persistence hydration and write-back

If this app were reimplemented, this provider would be the main source of truth for required behavior.

## Module Map

### App Shell

- `app/_layout.tsx`
  Root providers, theming, side-effect bootstrap.
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
  Bottom tabs only.

### Screens

- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
  Chat landing logic. Ensures a session exists and renders `ChatView` once available.
- `app/(tabs)/workspace.tsx`
  Project picker, active/archived session and worktree controls, plus conflict-checked text file editing.
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`
  Settings screen controller for connection, providers, MCP servers, notifications, and voice.
- `app/(tabs)/terminal.tsx`
  Fourth-tab line console for creating, opening, using, and terminating project PTYs.

### Provider Layer

- `providers/opencode-provider.tsx`
  Main orchestrator and context source.
- `providers/opencode-provider-types.ts`
  Shared public types and constants.
- `providers/opencode-provider-utils.ts`
  Preference defaults, config helpers, model/provider selection logic, permission config helpers.
- `providers/opencode-provider-selectors.ts`
  Derived selectors extracted from the provider body.
- `providers/use-opencode-persistence.ts`
  AsyncStorage hydration and persistence.
- `providers/use-conversation-keep-awake.ts`
  Keeps device awake during conversation mode.
- `providers/use-conversation-screen-dim.ts`
  Dims screen during conversation mode.

### Services

- `providers/services/session-service.ts`
  Fetch sessions, messages, diffs, todos, commands, and perform session lifecycle actions.
- `providers/services/capabilities-service.ts`
  Discover config, providers, provider auth methods, model capabilities, and agents.
- `providers/services/workspace-service.ts`
  File search/read/status, VCS patch, and experimental worktree requests.
- `providers/services/mcp-service.ts`
  MCP status, lifecycle, config enablement, and OAuth requests.
- `providers/services/terminal-service.ts`
  PTY lifecycle, shell discovery, connect-token, and WebSocket URL helpers.
- `providers/services/diagnostics-service.ts`
  Health, MCP, LSP, and formatter diagnostics with per-endpoint availability.

### OpenCode Protocol Helpers

- `lib/opencode/client.ts`
  Builds the OpenCode 1.18.3 v2 SDK client, normalizes server URL, adds optional basic auth, and preserves configured URL path prefixes.
- `lib/opencode/format.ts`
  Converts raw message records into transcript entries and helper labels.
- `lib/opencode/transcript.ts`
  Transcript activity helpers (including the per-message activity-row builder), and display filtering.
- `lib/opencode/types.ts`
  Direct aliases for generated v2 SDK protocol types.

### On-device Server Helpers

- `lib/termux.ts`
  On-device OpenCode via Termux: `TERMUX_SERVER_URL` constants, the pinned idempotent setup script, and typed status/launch helpers (`TermuxStatus`, `TermuxLaunchResult`). The Android-only native launcher lives in `modules/termux-launcher/` and is surfaced in the Settings `ConnectionSection`. Termux orchestration is a UI + lib concern; the provider is not involved beyond connecting to the local server URL.

### Chat UI

- `components/chat/chat-view.tsx`
  Main chat screen controller.
- `components/chat/chat-content.tsx`
  Transcript, pending interactions, task overlay, and diff tab rendering.

  Prompt input, attachments, and controls.
- `components/chat/chat-header.tsx`
  Session picker and conversation overlay mount point.
- `components/chat/chat-cards.tsx`
  Message, diff, and permission cards, including message fork/revert actions.
- `components/chat/chat-markdown.tsx`
  Small custom markdown renderer.
- `components/chat/chat-overlay.tsx`
  Full-screen conversation mode overlay.

### Settings UI

- `components/settings/settings-sections.tsx`
  Settings sections as presentational components.
- `components/settings/provider-config-dialog.tsx`
  Provider auth modal.
- `components/settings/settings-utils.ts`
  Provider copy and option lists.

### Platform Integrations

- `lib/notifications.ts`
  Local notifications, background monitoring task, and notification debug status.
- `lib/voice/speech-output.ts`
  Text-to-speech and audio ducking.
- `lib/voice/use-speech-input.ts`
  Speech recognition hook.
- `lib/voice/working-sound.ts`
  Generated looping working sound.

## Runtime Boot Sequence

The normal startup flow is:

1. Root layout mounts providers.
2. `useOpencodePersistence()` hydrates settings, chat preferences, active project, and last session map from AsyncStorage.
3. After hydration, `OpencodeProvider` calls `connect()`.
4. `connect()` loads workspace catalog using a catalog-scoped client with no directory.
5. Connection state becomes `connected` or `error`.
6. If a project exists, the provider fetches sessions and chat capabilities.
7. A follow-up effect calls `ensureActiveSession()` for the active project.
8. `ensureActiveSession()` reopens the remembered session, falls back to the newest returned session, or creates a new one.
9. The Chat tab can then render transcript, diffs, todos, pending interactions, and controls.

This boot chain is important because the Chat screen itself is not responsible for initial data ownership. It only triggers `ensureActiveSession()` when the provider has enough context.

## Client Topology

The provider creates two client instances:

- `client`
  Bound to `settings` plus `activeProjectPath`. Used for session-scoped calls.
- `catalogClient`
  Bound to `settings` with an empty directory. Used for workspace discovery, diagnostics, and the global event stream.

This split is one of the key architectural details. Workspace discovery is intentionally decoupled from a selected project directory.

## Data Flow Model

### Server -> Provider

The provider fetches and caches:

- workspace catalog
- sessions and statuses
- messages per session
- diffs per session
- todos per session
- pending permissions and questions by session, populated by events and refreshed from the server
- providers, models, and agents
- commands, workspace file status/search/read data, VCS information, and diagnostics
- archived sessions, worktrees, MCP statuses, PTYs, terminal connection state, and terminal output

### Provider -> Derived State

Selectors transform provider state into:

- current transcript
- session preview text
- visible configured providers
- current permissions and questions scoped to the active or sending session
- conversation status label

### Provider -> UI

Screens and components consume one context and render local presentation states.

### UI -> Provider

User interactions are converted to provider actions such as:

- `connect`
- `selectProject`
- `createSession`
- `openSession`
- `sendPrompt`
- `abortSession`
- `replyToPermission`
- `replyToQuestion` and `rejectQuestion`
- `deleteSession`, `renameSession`, `forkSession`, `revertSession`, and share actions
- `executeCommand`
- workspace search/read and diagnostics refresh actions
- workspace patch save, archive/restore, worktree, MCP, and terminal actions
- `setProviderAuth`
- `toggleConversationMode`

## Real-Time Update Architecture

The app uses two update strategies in parallel:

### Primary Strategy: SSE Subscription

When connected and a project is active, the provider opens `catalogClient.global.event()`. Global event envelopes are filtered by `directory === activeProjectPath` before their payload is handled. If the stream ends or fails, the provider reconnects indefinitely with exponential backoff from 1 second to 15 seconds.

Recognized events update local state or schedule refreshes for:

- session creation/update/deletion
- session status changes
- session idle completion
- message updates
- message part updates/removals
- session diff updates
- todo updates
- permission and question requests/replies

### Safety Strategy: Polling Fallback

The provider keeps a 5-second polling loop when any of the following is true:

- SSE is not connected
- any session is non-idle
- a prompt is currently being submitted
- conversation mode is active

Polling refreshes sessions, current/conversation session content, and pending interactions as needed. The `/permission` and `/question` list APIs recover requests missed by SSE.

`permission.asked` and `question.asked` insert requests under their `sessionID`; reply and rejection events remove them. Opening or refreshing a session reconciles both maps with the server.

This dual model is critical. The implementation does not trust SSE alone.

## Screen Responsibilities

### Chat Screen

`ChatView` is the main operator surface.

Responsibilities:

- render session transcript
- render pending permission and question interactions inline
- render diff tab
- send prompts and attachments
- suggest and execute server-provided slash commands
- fork from or revert to a user message, and undo a session revert
- toggle auto-approve
- select agent/model/reasoning
- start/stop microphone dictation for the draft box
- start/stop conversation mode
- play assistant replies via TTS
- abort running sessions
- create and switch sessions

### Workspace Screen

Responsibilities:

- show connection summary for workspace context
- refresh workspace catalog and sessions
- select active project
- create/open sessions
- rename and permanently delete sessions
- share/unshare sessions and copy a newly created share URL
- archive active sessions; restore or permanently delete sessions from the experimental archived list
- search, read, and edit text workspace files; saving re-reads for conflicts and applies a full-file VCS patch
- create, list, reset, and remove worktrees through experimental endpoints
- show changed-file count and current VCS branch

### Settings Screen

Responsibilities:

- edit connection settings
- reconnect manually
- set up and start the on-device Termux server; switch the server URL to the local `http://127.0.0.1:4096`
- inspect server health, realtime status, LSP, and formatter counts
- add local or remote MCP servers; connect, disconnect, enable, disable, and complete remote OAuth
- configure providers
- remove configured provider credentials
- choose model enablement defaults
- inspect and enable notification setup
- manage voice and response-style preferences

### Terminal Screen

Responsibilities:

- list available shells and project PTYs
- create, open/reconnect, and terminate PTYs
- request a short-lived connect ticket and stream PTY data over a project-scoped WebSocket
- provide a line-oriented input/output console rather than a full terminal emulator

The provider strips common ANSI CSI sequences and retains only the latest 100,000 output characters. It does not emulate cursor movement or other VT terminal behavior.

## Conversation Mode Architecture

Conversation mode is a provider-level state machine with phases:

- `off`
- `listening`
- `submitting`
- `waiting`
- `speaking`

Supporting behaviors include:

- continuous speech recognition
- final-result settling delay before submission
- automatic assistant reply playback
- optional automatic return to listening after playback
- keep-awake activation
- brightness dimming
- blocking if pending permissions or questions exist
- cancellation and cleanup across timers, speech input, TTS, and working sound

This is one of the densest parts of the architecture and would need careful parity in any rewrite.

## Presentation Architecture Notes

- The app uses custom theme tokens from `constants/theme.ts` and maps them into React Native Paper in `constants/paper-theme.ts`.
- Markdown rendering is intentionally narrow and custom, not library-based.
- Diff rendering is custom and optimized for readable in-app inspection, not full git-style fidelity.
- The chat area surfaces server-owned todos in a collapsed overlay with read-only status icons. It does not mutate todo state.
- Working sound is started by the provider while a send or any session is busy, when enabled, except during listening and speaking phases.

## Architectural Hotspots

The highest-coupling areas are:

### `providers/opencode-provider.tsx`

This is the main behavioral hotspot. Changes here can affect nearly every screen.

### Prompt lifecycle

`sendPrompt()`, notification tracking, session refresh, summarization, attachment capability checks, and attachment encoding are tightly coupled.

### Conversation mode

It spans provider state, timers, speech recognition, TTS, keep-awake, brightness, and chat state.

### Capability refresh

Provider/model/agent choices depend on server config, configured providers, current preferences, and stored selections.

## Reimplementation Guidance

If the system is rebuilt, the safest parity-preserving architecture would keep these concepts intact:

- one central orchestration layer
- a separate workspace-discovery client from a project-scoped session client
- combined SSE + polling safety net
- persisted connection/preferences/project/session identity state
- transcript model derived from raw message parts rather than storing rendered text only
- explicit conversation mode state machine
- event-driven handling for session-scoped permission blocking flows

Those are implementation-defining patterns, not incidental details.
